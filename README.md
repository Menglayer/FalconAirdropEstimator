Single-file static site. Deploy on GitHub Pages:

1. Create a new repo named **<your-username>.github.io** (or any repo).
2. Upload `index.html` and `.nojekyll` (keep the filename exactly).
3. Go to **Settings → Pages** → **Build and deployment** → Source: *Deploy from a branch* → Branch: `main` → Folder: `/ (root)`.
4. Wait 1–2 minutes. Your site will be at:
   - https://<your-username>.github.io  (if repo is `<username>.github.io`), or
   - https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo>/ (for other repo names).
